Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::HEEB
=======================================

This Dist::Zilla plugin bundle is used by
[Elmar Heeb](https://metacpan.org/author/HEEB) to build the CPAN distributions
that he authors. It is used as a convenience and to ensure consistency among
builds.  While it is subject to adjustments at any time using the plugin bundle
ensures that the current conventions chosen by the author are used.

The Dist::Zilla plugins used are best looked up in the source of the plugin
bundle. Use `perldoc -m Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::HEEB`

Plugin bundles should reflect best practices. However, there is no one
canonical best way to do something. Even the best tools are only as good as
they are understood by an author. As such the plugin bundle is a moving target
reflecting personal preferences and past experiences.

E.g., this author likes to use `PruneFiles` so as to exclude the `debian`
directory from the CPAN distribution. The Debian package is directly built from
the upstream source using `dzil` via
[`dh-dist-zilla`](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/dh-dist-zilla) rather than
from the CPAN
distribution.

Self-Referencing
----------------

This plugin bundle is self-referencing. It needs itself to build itself. This
is easily achieved by using the `-Ilib` options when calling `dzil`. The
`debian/rules` file automatically takes care of this.

The downstream CPAN distribution requires neither Dist::Zilla nor this plugin
bundle to be installed.  However, being a plugin bundle for Dist::Zilla its use
only makes sense in conjunction with Dist::Zilla.
